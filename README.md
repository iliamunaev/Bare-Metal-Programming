# Bare-Metal and ESP32-S3 Projects for Arduino UNO R4 WiFi (Renesas RA4M1)
This repository contains a set of projects demonstrating **bare-metal programming** on the Renesas RA4M1 microcontroller and projects using the ESP32-S3 Wi-Fi/Bluetooth module, both of which are part of the Arduino UNO R4 WiFi board. 

The projects cover low-level hardware control on the RA4M1 as well as wireless communication using the ESP32-S3 module.

 _NOTE: Arduino API, framework are not used_
