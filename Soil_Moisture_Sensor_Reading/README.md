# Soil Moisture Sensor Reading 

## 1. Voltage Reader  
Reads the analog voltage from a Soil Moisture Sensor connected to analog pin A0 and prints the voltage to the Serial Monitor.  


**HAL code:** [read_output_voltage.ino](read_output_voltage.ino)

## 2. Humidity Reader
Reads the analog value from a Soil Moisture Sensor connected to analog pin A0 and prints the voltage to the Serial Monitor.  


**HAL code:** [read_humidity.ino](read_humidity.ino)

## Usage
Ready to use via Arduino IDE: copy and flash the desired .ino files to your board.
